Brief Introduction
=====
I received the dual B.Eng. degrees in Electronic Science and Technology from [University of Liverpool (UoL)](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk) and [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU)](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en) with first class honours, Suzhou, China, in 2021.

After that, I received the M.Phil. degree in Individualized Interdisciplinary Program (Microelectronics) (IIP-MICS) under the supervision of [Prof. Zhirui Zong](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/ZONG-Zhirui/zong) and [Prof. Jiang Xu](https://eexu.home.ece.ust.hk) from [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk), Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, in 2024. From 2022 fall to 2023 winter, I moved to [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn) for cross campus study.
