Preface
=====
Nice to see you here. This group is incubated and established in Jan. 2024 supported by Shenjian Zhang (Founder), Dian Sheng (Co-founder), and Prof. Chun Zhao (XJTLU). The initial target aims to innovate state-of-the-art analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits and systems, expecially corresponding with CMOS-based and synaptic-device-based artificial intelligence intergrated circuit (AIIC) designs and applications. Up to now, our group conducts several projects in the fields of AD/DA converter, DC-DC converter, and transceiver.

Current Research
=====
1. A 10-bit Coarse-Fine SAR ADC with Offset Compensation
2. Low Latency Sigma-Delta ADC
3. Digital Front-End for Audio Power Amplifier
4. A Coarse-Fine Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) Design with Differential Current-Steering and Arithmetic Charge-Distribution
5. VCO......

Completed Projects
=====
1. A High-Efficient DC-DC Buck Converter based on Valley Current Mode with ACOT Scheme
2. A Compact Multi-Bit Multi-Order FIR DAC Design for Internet of Things
3. Synaptic Thin-Film Transistor Model based on Behavioral Simulation
